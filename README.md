# nperiodic_table

Slightly improved rendering of periodic table.

The primary improvement is that the text in the boxes is properly centered.

There are three branches:

- a detailed periodic table with electronegativities & subshell information
- a simplified version.
- a simplified version with formulas on page 2.

There are also some chemistry-related ornaments decorating the document.
